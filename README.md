# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots 

This project looks into Pymaceuticals Inc.'s, a pharmaceutical company specializing in anticancer pharmaceuticals, and their most recent efforts to find a potential treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). With access to their data from the most recent animal study, I analyze, develop insights and draw conclusions based off the data provided. In this study, there were 249 mice identified to have an SCC tumor growth, which were then treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. The following tables and figures will supplement the company's technical report needed for the study, by providing cohesive analysis and observations of the data.

## Summary Statistics ##

## Bar and Pie Charts ##

### Bar Charts ### 
Two bar charts using identical data were generated. The first bar chart was generated using `Pandas .plot.bar()` function, and the second bar chart was generated using `Pyplot plt.bar()` function. Below I provided just the Pyplot bar chart, as both bar charts are statistically identical. To view the Pandas bar chart, please scroll to the approprite section within Jupter Notebook. 

The bar chart gives a visual representation of the total number of datapoints for each drug regimen. The chart shows that Capomulion, Pymaceutical's drug, had the most datapoints, and Propriva has the least amount of data points.

### Pie Charts ### 

Similarly to the bar charts, two pie were generated as well. The first pie chart was generated using `Pandas .plot.pie()` function, and the second pie chart was generated using `Pyplot plt.pie()` function. Below I provided just the Pyplot pie chart. Since, again, both pie charts statistically identical. To view the Pandas pie chart, please scroll to the approprite section within Jupter Notebook. 

The pie chart gives a visual representation of the distribution of male versus female mice. The chart shows there were slightly more males in the study than females.
