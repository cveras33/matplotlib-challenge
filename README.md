# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots 

This project looks into Pymaceuticals Inc.'s, a pharmaceutical company specializing in anticancer pharmaceuticals, and their most recent efforts to find a potential treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). With access to their data from the most recent animal study, I analyze, develop insights and draw conclusions based off the data provided. In this study, there were 249 mice identified to have an SCC tumor growth, which were then treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. The following tables and figures will supplement the company's technical report needed for the study, by providing cohesive analysis and observations of the data.
